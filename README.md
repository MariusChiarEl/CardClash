Card Clash is a personal project with the aim to learn the .NET and WPF frameworks and the basics of game design and development.

Feel free to critique my work and suggest changes in the functionality or implementation as you see fit. Any input is highly appreciated.

This will be a simple game in which players (2-4) take turns placing playing cards on the table.

Rules:

- The game starts with a random card in the center
- Each player chooses a spot adjacent to any of the cards on the table, draws a card from the deck and places it
- The player gets points equal to the difference between the placed card and the lowest value adjacent card (example: placing a 5-card next to a 9-card and a 3-card will award the player 2 points)
- Ace = 1 point, Jack = 11 points, Queen = 12 points, King = 13 points
- First player to get to X points / The player with the highest point count after X rounds wins.


Beside the base of this game, I may add arcade-ish abilities in the future, such as:
- Revealing the card they are going to draw,
- Gaining an extra round,
- Skipping the next opponent's round,
- Removing a chosen card from the table
etc.
